# Star Dodger V2 2024 Remake

A recreation of Star Dodger, a game concept that appears to trace its origins to N. Silver's "Asterisk Tracker" published in BEEBUG Magazine (December 1984), later independently developed as Star Dodger by Stewart Russell in 1988 and reimagined as Star Dodger V2 by Graham French in 1992. 

The concept's journey through gaming history:
- 1984: N. Silver's "Asterisk Tracker" (BEEBUG Magazine)
- 1988: Stewart Russell's Star Dodger series (Amstrad Computer User):
  - **Stardodger I** (BASIC Version)
  - **Stardodger II** (BCPL Version)
  - **Stardodger III** (Assembler Version)
- 1992: Graham French's Star Dodger V2 (Amstrad Action)
- 2024: This JavaScript remake

This remake is a tribute to the enduring creativity and evolution of this gameplay concept. As a child, I fondly remembered typing in Star Dodger V2 from *Amstrad Action* magazine, unaware of both the earlier versions and the original concept. Revisiting this history has been both enlightening and inspiring.

## üèÜ High Score Challenge

The current known high score is 1288 which happened during development by me with an utterly minimal and unfocused attempt. Can you beat it while maintaining your focus through the mesmerizing star patterns?

## üíù Dedication

This game is dedicated to:
- N. Silver, whose 1984 "Asterisk Tracker" first introduced this addictive gameplay concept
- Stewart Russell, who developed the Star Dodger series in 1988 for *Amstrad Computer User* magazine
- Graham French, who reimagined Star Dodger in 1992 for *Amstrad Action* magazine as Star Dodger V2

The core mechanics, from avoiding "space acid poisoning" in 1984 to the "fiendishly difficult and very, very addictive" gameplay of later versions, remain compelling to this day. This project aims to celebrate and preserve this fascinating piece of gaming history and its evolution through the 8-bit era.
