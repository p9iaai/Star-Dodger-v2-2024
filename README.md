## üíù Dedication

This game is dedicated to Graham French, who created the original Star Dodger V2 for Amstrad Action magazine in 1992. His creation brought joy to many CPC gamers, including myself, with its elegant simplicity and addictive gameplay.

The original game was described in the magazine as "an absolute corker" where "you have to cross the star field without hitting the meanies and squeeze through a black hole at the far side of the screen." The core mechanic - a ship moving diagonally at tremendous speed with only the space bar to alter its direction - was praised as "fiendishly difficult and very, very addictive."

The fact that these gameplay mechanics remained so clear in memory after 30+ years really speaks to how well-designed the original was. Those type-in listings in magazines like Amstrad Action were often gems of efficient design - they had to be, given the memory constraints and the fact that someone had to physically type them in!

Thank you, Graham French, for creating such a memorable game. This project aims to preserve and celebrate your contribution to 8-bit gaming history.
