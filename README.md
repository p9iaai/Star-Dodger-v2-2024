# Star Dodger V2 2024 Remake

A recreation of Star Dodger, a game concept originally developed by Stewart Russell in 1988 and later reimagined as Star Dodger V2 by Graham French in 1992. Stewart Russell's foundational work for *Amstrad Computer User* magazine laid the groundwork for this timeless gameplay experience, with three distinct versions:

- **Stardodger I** (BASIC Version)
- **Stardodger II** (BCPL Version)
- **Stardodger III** (Assembler Version)

This remake is a tribute to the enduring creativity and adaptability of the original concept. As a child, I fondly remembered typing in Star Dodger V2 from *Amstrad Action* magazine, unaware of the earlier versions. Revisiting this history has been both enlightening and inspiring. Thank you, Stewart Russell, for creating a concept that has captivated players for decades.

## üèÜ High Score Challenge

The current known high score is 1288 which happened during development by me with an utterly minimal and unfocused attempt. Can you beat it while maintaining your focus through the mesmerizing star patterns?

## üíù Dedication

This game is dedicated to Stewart Russell, who first developed the Star Dodger concept in 1988 for *Amstrad Computer User* magazine. His versions showcased the adaptability of the idea through BASIC, BCPL, and Assembler implementations, demonstrating the ingenuity of early computer game developers.

Recognition is also owed to Graham French, who reimagined Star Dodger in 1992 for *Amstrad Action* magazine as Star Dodger V2. His iteration brought the game to a wider audience, and its simplicity and addictive gameplay remain a fond memory for many.

The original mechanics, described as "fiendishly difficult and very, very addictive," remain compelling to this day. This project aims to celebrate and preserve the contributions of both Stewart Russell and Graham French to 8-bit gaming history.
